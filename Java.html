<p>
Hello and welcome to <i>Teach Yourself
Java in 21 Days</i>! Starting today and for the next few weeks
you'll learn all about the Java language and how to use it to
create programs that run inside Web pages (called applets) and
programs that can run on their own (called applications).
</p><p>
That's the overall goal for the next couple weeks. Today, the
goals are somewhat more modest, and you'll learn about the following:
</p><ul>
<li>What exactly Java is, and its current status
</li><li>Why you should learn Java-its various features and advantages
over other programming languages
</li><li>Getting started programming in Java-what you'll need in terms
of software and background, as well as some basic terminology
</li><li>How to create your first Java programs-to close this day,
you'll create both a simple Java application and a simple Java
applet!
</li></ul>
<h2><a name="WhatIsJava"><font size="5" color="#FF0000">
What Is Java?</font></a></h2>
<p>
Based on the enormous amount of press Java is getting and the
amount of excitement it has generated, you may get the impression
that Java will save the world-or at least solve all the problems
of the Internet. Not so. Java's hype has run far ahead of its
capabilities, and while Java is indeed new and interesting, it
really is another programming language with which you write programs
that run on the Internet. In this respect, Java is closer to popular
programming languages such as C, C++, Visual Basic, or Pascal,
than it is to a page description language such as HTML, or a very
simple scripting language such as JavaScript.
</p><p>
More specifically, Java is an object-oriented programming language
developed by Sun Microsystems, a company best known for its high-end
UNIX workstations. Modeled after C++, the Java language was designed
to be small, simple, and portable across platforms and operating
systems, both at the source and at the binary level, which means
that Java programs (applets and applications) can run on any machine
that has the Java virtual machine installed (you'll learn more
about this later).
</p><p>
Java is usually mentioned in the context of the World Wide Web,
where browsers such as Netscape's Navigator and Microsoft's Internet
Explorer claim to be "Java enabled." <i>Java
enabled </i>means that the browser in question can download
and play Java programs, called <i>applets</i>,
on the reader's system. Applets appear in a Web page much the
same way as images do, but unlike images, applets are dynamic
and interactive. Applets can be used to create animation, figures,
forms that immediately respond to input from the reader, games,
or other interactive effects on the same Web pages among the text
and graphics. Figure 1.1 shows an applet running in Netscape 3.0.
(This applet, at <tt><a href="http://prominence.com/java/poetry/">http://prominence.com/java/poetry/</a></tt>,
is an electronic version of the refrigerator magnets that you
can move around to create poetry or messages.)

<p>
</p><p>
To create an applet, you write it in the Java language, compile
it using a Java compiler, and refer to that applet in your HTML
Web pages. You put the resulting HTML and Java files on a Web
site in the same way that you make ordinary HTML and image files
available. Then, when someone using a Java-enabled browser views
your page with the embedded applet, that browser downloads the
applet to the local system and executes it, allowing your reader
to view and interact with your applet in all its glory. (Readers
using other browsers may see text, a static graphic, or nothing.)
You'll learn more about how applets, browsers, and the World Wide
Web work together later in this book.
</p><p>
While applets are probably the most popular use of Java, the important
thing to understand about Java is that you can do so much more
with it than create and use applets. Java was written as a full-fledged
general-purpose programming language in which you can accomplish
the same sorts of tasks and solve the same sorts of problems that
you can in other programming languages, such as C or C++.
</p><h2><a name="JavasPastPresentandFuture"><font size="5" color="#FF0000">
Java's Past, Present, and Future</font></a></h2>
<p>
The Java language was developed at Sun Microsystems in 1991 as
part of a research project to develop software for consumer electronics
devices-television sets, VCRs, toasters, and the other sorts of
machines you can buy at any department store. Java's goals at
that time were to be small, fast, efficient, and easily portable
to a wide range of hardware devices. Those same goals made Java
an ideal language for distributing executable programs via the
World Wide Web and also a general-purpose programming language
for developing programs that are easily usable and portable across
different platforms.
</p><p>
The Java language was used in several projects within Sun (under
the name Oak), but did not get very much commercial attention
until it was paired with HotJava. HotJava, an experimental World
Wide Web browser, was written in 1994 in a matter of months, both
as a vehicle for downloading and running applets and also as an
example of the sort of complex application that can be written
in Java. Although HotJava got a lot of attention in the Web community,
it wasn't until Netscape incorporated HotJava's ability to play
applets into its own browser that Java really took off and started
to generate the excitement that it has both on and off the World
Wide Web. Java has generated so much excitement, in fact, that
inside Sun the Java group spun off into its own subsidiary called
JavaSoft.
</p><p>
Versions of Java itself, or, as it's most commonly called, the
Java API, correspond to versions of Sun's Java Developer's Kit,
or JDK. As of this writing, the current version of the JDK is
1.0.2. Previously released versions of the JDK (alphas and betas)
did not have all the features or had a number of security-related
bugs. Most Java tools and browsers conform to the features in
the 1.0.2 JDK, and all the examples in this book run on that version
as well.
</p><p>
The next major release of the JDK and therefore of the Java API
will be 1.1, with a prerelease version available sometime in the
later part of 1996. This release will have few changes to the
language, but a number of additional capabilities and features
added to the class library. Throughout this book, if a feature
will change or will be enhanced in 1.1, we'll let you know, and
in the last two days of this book you'll find out more about new
Java features for 1.1 and for the future. 
</p><p>
Currently, to program in Java, you'll need a Java development
environment of some sort for your platform. Sun's JDK works just
fine for this purpose and includes tools for compiling and testing
Java applets and applications. In addition, a wide variety of
excellent Java development environments have been developed, including
Sun's own Java Workshop, Symantec's Caf√©, Microsoft's Visual
J++ (which is indeed a Java tool, despite its name), and Natural
Intelligence's Roaster, with more development tools appearing
all the time.
</p><p>
To run and view Java applets, you'll need a Java-enabled browser
or other tool. As mentioned before, recent versions of Netscape
Navigator (2.0 and higher) and Internet Explorer (3.0) can both
run Java applets. (Note that for Windows you'll need the 32-bit
version of Netscape, and for Macintosh you'll need Netscape 3.0.)
You can also use Sun's own HotJava browser to view applets, as
long as you have the 1.0 prebeta version (older versions are not
compatible with newer applets, and vice versa). Even if you don't
have a Java-enabled browser, many development tools provide simple
viewers with which you can run your applets. The JDK comes with
one of these; it's called the <tt>appletviewer</tt>.

If you're running Windows 3.x as your main system, very few tools exist for you to be able to work with Java. As I write this, the only Java tool available for writing and running Java applets is a version of the JDK from IBM called the ADK. You can write 
applets using this tool, and view them using the applet viewer that comes with that package (neither Netscape nor Internet Explorer will run Java applets on Windows 3.1). See <tt><a href="http://www.alphaWorks.ibm.com/">http://www.alphaWorks.ibm.com/</a></tt> for more information.

</p><p>
What's in store for Java in the future? A number of new developments
have been brewing (pardon the pun):
</p><ul>
<li>Sun is developing a number of new features for the Java environment,
including a number of new class libraries for database integration,
multimedia, electronic commerce, and other uses. Sun also has
a Java-based Web server, a Java-based hardware chip (with which
you can write Java-specific systems), and a Java-based operating
system. You'll learn about all these things later in this book.
The 1.1 release of the JDK will include many of these features;
others will be released as separate packages.
</li><li>Sun is also developing a framework called Java Beans, which
will allow the development of component objects in Java, similarly
to Microsoft's ActiveX (OLE) tech-nology. These different components
can then be easily combined and interact with each other using
standard component assembly tools. You'll learn more about Java
Beans later in this book.
</li><li>Java capabilities will be incorporated into a wide variety
of operating systems, including Solaris, Windows 95, and MacOS.
This means that Java applications (as opposed to applets) can
run nearly anywhere without needing additional software to be
installed.
</li><li>Many companies are working on performance enhancements for
Java programs, including the aforementioned Java chip and what
are called just-in-time compilers.
</li></ul>
<h2><a name="WhyLearnJava"><font size="5" color="#FF0000">
Why Learn Java?</font></a></h2>
<p>
At the moment, probably the most compelling reason to learn Java-and
probably the reason you bought this book-is that applets are written
in Java. Even if that were not the case, Java as a programming
language has significant advantages over other languages and other
environments that make it suitable for just about any programming
task. This section describes some of those advantages.
</p><h3><a name="JavaIsPlatformIndependent">
Java Is Platform Independent</a></h3>
<p>
Platform independence-that is, the ability of a program to move
easily from one computer system to another-is one of the most
significant advantages that Java has over other programming languages,
particularly if your software needs to run on many different platforms.
If you're writing software for the World Wide Web, being able
to run the same program on many different systems is crucial to
that program's success. Java is platform independent at both the
source and the binary level.<br>
</p><p>
</p><center>
<table bordercolor="#000000" border="1" width="80%">
<tbody><tr valign="TOP"><td><b>New Term</b>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="TOP"><td>
<blockquote>
Platform independence means that a program can run on any computer system. Java programs can run on any system for which a Java virtual machine has been installed.
</blockquote>

</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>
<p>
</p><p>
At the source level, Java's primitive data types have consistent
sizes across all development platforms. Java's foundation class
libraries make it easy to write code that can be moved from platform
to platform without the need to rewrite it to work with that platform.
When you write a program in Java, you don't need to rely on features
of that particular operating system to accomplish basic tasks.
Platform independence at the source level means that you can move
Java source files from system to system and have them compile
and run cleanly on any system. 
</p><p>
Platform independence in Java doesn't stop at the source level,
however. Java compiled binary files are also platform independent
and can run on multiple platforms (if they have a Java virtual
machine available) without the need to recompile the source.
</p><p>
Normally, when you compile a program written in C or in most other
languages, the compiler translates your program into machine code
or processor instructions. Those instructions are specific to
the processor your computer is running-so, for example, if you
compile your code on an Intel-based system, the resulting program
will run only on other Intel-based systems. If you want to use
the same program on another system, you have to go back to your
original source code, get a compiler for that system, and recompile
your code so that you have a program specific to that system.
Figure 1.2 shows the result of this system: multiple executable
programs for multiple systems.
</p><p>
<a href="f1-2.gif"><b>Figure 1.2 : </b><i>Traditional compiled programs</i>.</a>
</p><p>
Things are different when you write code in Java. The Java development
environment actually has two parts: a Java compiler and a Java
interpreter. The Java compiler takes your Java program and, instead
of generating machine codes from your source files, it generates
bytecodes. Bytecodes are
instructions that look a lot like machine code, but are not specific
to any one processor.
</p><p>
To execute a Java program, you run a program called a bytecode
interpreter, which in turn reads the bytecodes and executes your
Java program (see Figure 1.3). The Java bytecode interpreter is
often also called the Java virtual machine or the Java runtime.
</p><p>

<blockquote>
Java bytecodes are a special set of machine instructions that are not specific to any one processor or computer system. A platform-specific bytecode interpreter executes the Java bytecodes. The bytecode interpreter is also called the Java 
virtual machine or the Java runtime interpreter.
</blockquote>

</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>
<p>
</p><p>
Where do you get the bytecode interpreter? For applets, the bytecode
interpreter is built into every Java-enabled browser, so you don't
have to worry about it-Java applets just automatically run. For
more general Java applications, you'll need to have the interpreter
installed on your system in order to run that Java program. Right
now, you can get the Java interpreter as part of your development
environment, or if you buy a Java program, you'll get it with
that package. In the future, however, the Java bytecode interpreter
will most likely come with every new operating system-buy a Windows
machine, and you'll get Java for free.
</p><p>
Why go through all the trouble of adding this extra layer of the
bytecode interpreter? Having your Java programs in bytecode form
means that instead of being specific to any one system, your programs
can be run on any platform and any operating or window system
as long as the Java interpreter is available. This capability
of a single binary file to be executable across platforms is crucial
to what makes applets work because the World Wide Web itself is
also platform independent. Just as HTML files can be read on any
platform, so can applets be executed on any platform that has
a Java-enabled browser.
</p><p>
The disadvantage of using bytecodes is in execution speed. Because
system-specific programs run directly on the hardware for which
they are compiled, they run significantly faster than Java bytecodes,
which must be processed by the interpreter. For many basic Java
programs, speed may not be an issue. If you write programs that
require more execution speed than the Java interpreter can provide,
you have several solutions available to you, including being able
to link native code into your Java program or using special tools
(called just-in-time compilers)
to convert your Java bytecodes into native code and speed up their
execution. Note that by using any of these solutions, you lose
the portability that Java bytecodes provide. You'll learn about
each of these mechanisms on <a href="ch20.htm">Day 20</a>, "Using Native Methods
and Libraries."
</p><h3><a name="JavaIsObjectOriented">
Java Is Object Oriented</a></h3>
<p>
To some, the object-oriented programming (OOP) technique is merely
a way of organizing programs, and it can be accomplished using
any language. Working with a real object-oriented language and
programming environment, however, enables you to take full advantage
of object-oriented methodology and its capabilities for creating
flexible, modular programs and reusing code.
</p><p>
Many of Java's object-oriented concepts are inherited from C++,
the language on which it is based, but it borrows many concepts
from other object-oriented languages as well. Like most object-oriented
programming languages, Java includes a set of class libraries
that provide basic data types, system input and output capabilities,
and other utility functions. These basic libraries are part of
the standard Java environment, which also includes simple libraries,
form networking, common Internet protocols, and user interface
toolkit functions. Because these class libraries are written in
Java, they are portable across platforms as all Java applications
are.
</p><p>
You'll learn more about object-oriented programming and Java tomorrow.
</p><h3><a name="JavaIsEasytoLearn">
Java Is Easy to Learn</a></h3>
<p>
In addition to its portability and object orientation, one of
Java's initial design goals was to be small and simple, and therefore
easier to write, easier to compile, easier to debug, and, best
of all, easy to learn. Keeping the language small also makes it
more robust because there are fewer chances for programmers to
make mistakes that are difficult to fix. Despite its size and
simple design, however, Java still has a great deal of power and
flexibility.
</p><p>
Java is modeled after C and C++, and much of the syntax and object-oriented
structure is borrowed from the latter. If you are familiar with
C++, learning Java will be particularly easy for you because you
have most of the foundation already. (In fact, you may find yourself
skipping through the first week of this book fairly rapidly. Go
ahead; I won't mind.)
</p><p>
Although Java looks similar to C and C++, most of the more complex
parts of those languages have been excluded from Java, making
the language simpler without sacrificing much of its power. There
are no pointers in Java, nor is there pointer arithmetic. Strings
and arrays are real objects in Java. Memory management is automatic.
To an experienced programmer, these omissions may be difficult
to get used to, but to beginners or programmers who have worked
in other languages, they make the Java language far easier to
learn.
</p><p>
However, while Java's design makes it easier to learn than other
programming languages, working with a programming language is
still a great deal more complicated than, say, working in HTML.
If you have no programming language background at all, you may
find Java difficult to understand and to grasp. But don't be discouraged!
Learning programming is a valuable skill for the Web and for computers
in general, and Java is a terrific language to start out with.
</p><h2><a name="GettingStartedProgramminginJava"><font size="5" color="#FF0000">
Getting Started Programming in Java</font></a></h2>
<p>
Enough background! For the second half of this day let's actually
dive into simple Java programming and create two Java programs:
a standalone Java application and an applet that you can view
in a Java-enabled browser. Although both these programs are extremely
simple, they will give you an idea of what a Java program looks
like and how to compile and run it.
</p><h3><a name="GettingaJavaDevelopmentEnvironment">
Getting a Java Development Environment</a></h3>
<p>
In order to write Java programs, you will, of course, need a Java
development environment. (Although browsers such as Netscape allow
you to play Java applets, they don't let you write them. For that
you'll need a separate tool.) Sun's JDK, which is available for
downloading at the JavaSoft Web site (<tt><a href="http://www.javasoft.com/">http://www.javasoft.com/</a></tt>)
and included on the CD for this book, will do just fine. It runs
on Solaris, Windows 95 and NT, and Macintosh. However, despite
the JDK's popularity, it is not the easiest development tool to
use. If you're used to using a graphical user interface-based
development tool with an integrated editor and debugger, you'll
most likely find the JDK's command-line interfaces rather primitive.
Fortunately, the JDK is not the only tool in town.
</p><p>
As mentioned earlier, a number of third-party development environments
(called integrated development environments,
or IDEs) are also available for developing in Java. These include
Sun's Java Workshop for Solaris, Windows NT and Windows 95 (you
can get more information about it at <tt><a href="http://www.sun.com/developer-products/java/">http://www.sun.com/developer-products/java/</a></tt>);
Symantec's Caf√© for Windows 95, Windows NT, and Macintosh
(<tt><a href="http://cafe.symantec.com/">http://cafe.symantec.com/</a></tt>);
Microsoft's Visual J++ for Windows 95 and Windows NT (<tt><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualj/">http://www.microsoft.com/visualj/</a></tt>);
and Natural Intelligence's Roaster (<tt><a href="http://www.natural.com/pages/products/roaster/index.html">http://www.natural.com/pages/products/roaster/index.html</a></tt>).
All three are commercial programs, but you might be able to download
trial or limited versions of these programs to try them out. You'll
learn more about the features and capabilities of the various
Java IDEs on <a href="ch22.htm">Day 22</a>, "Java Programming Tools."<br>

To install the JDK or the sample files on the Macintosh, double-click
the installation program on the CD-ROM. By default, the package
will be installed into the folder <tt>Java</tt>
on your hard disk; you can install it anywhere on your disk that
you'd like. You'll be given options to install the JDK, the sample
files, and various other extra files; choose the options you want

The CD-ROM for this book contains the tarred and zipped JDK in
the directory <tt>jdk/solaris/jdk1.02.tgz</tt>.
Using the utilities <tt>gunzip</tt>
and <tt>tar</tt>, you can extract
the contents of that file anywhere on the file system you would
like. For example, if you copy the <tt>.tgz</tt>
file to your home directory and use the following commands to
extract it, you'll end up with a <tt>java</tt>
directory that contains the full JDK:
</p><blockquote>
<pre>gunzip ./jdk1.02.tgz
tar xvf ./jdk1.02.tar
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Note that in the directory <tt>java\lib</tt>
there is a file called <tt>classes.zip</tt>.
Do not unzip this file; it
needs to remain in zip form for it to work correctly. The file
<tt>java\src.zip</tt> contains the
source code for many of the JDK libraries; you can unzip this
one if you're interested in the source code.
</p><p>
The sample files are also contained on the CD-ROM in <tt>authors/authors.tar</tt>.
Create a directory where the sample files will live (for example,
a directory called <tt>javasamples</tt>
in your home directory), copy the <tt>authors.tar</tt>
file there, and then use the <tt>tar</tt>
command to extract it, like this:
</p><blockquote>
<pre>mkdir ~/javasamples
cp /cdrom/authors/authors.tar
tar xvf authors.tar

<h3><a name="ConfiguringtheJDK">
Configuring the JDK</a></h3>
<p>
If you've installed the JDK using the setup programs from the
CD-ROM, chances are good that it has been correctly configured
for you. However, because most common problems with Java result
from configuration errors, I recommend that you double-check your
configuration to make sure everything is right. And if you've
installed the JDK from a source other than the CD-ROM, you'll
definitely want to read this section to make sure you're all set
up. <br>

<p>
Somewhere in that line you should see an entry for the JDK; if
you installed the JDK from CD-ROM, it'll look something like this
(the dots are there to indicate that there may be other stuff
on this line):
</p><blockquote>
<pre>PATH C:\WINDOWS; ... C:\TEAchY~1\JDK\BIN; ...

If you cannot find any reference to <tt>JDK\BIN</tt>

The <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> variable may
also have other entries in it for Netscape or Internet Explorer,

If your <tt>autoexec.bat</tt> file
does not include either of these locations, add a line to the

<h3><a name="CreatingaJavaApplication">
Creating a Java Application</a></h3>
<p>
Now let's actually get to work. We'll start by creating a simple
Java application: the classic Hello World example that many programming
language books use to begin.
</p><p>
Java applications are different from Java applets. Applets, as
you have learned, are Java programs that are downloaded over the
World Wide Web and executed by a Web browser on the reader's machine.
Applets depend on a Java-enabled browser in order to run.<br>

Java applications, however, are more general programs written in the Java language. Java applications don't require a browser to run; in fact, Java can be used to create all the kinds of applications that you would normally use a more conventional

</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>
<p>
</p><p>
Java applications are standalone
Java programs that do not require a Web browser to run. Java applications
are more general-purpose programs such as you'd find on any computer.
</p><p>
A single Java program can be an applet or an application, or both,
depending on how you write that program and the capabilities that
program uses. Throughout this first week as you learn the Java
language, you'll be writing mostly applications; then you'll apply
what you've learned to write applets in Week 2. If you're eager
to get started with applets, be patient. Everything that you learn
while you're creating simple Java applications will apply to creating
applets, and it's easier to start with the basics before moving
onto the hard stuff. You'll be creating plenty of applets in Week
2.
</p><h4>Creating the Source File</h4>
<p>
As with all programming languages, your Java source files are
created in a plain text editor, or in an editor that can save
files in plain ASCII without any formatting characters. On UNIX,
<tt>emacs</tt>, <tt>pico</tt>,
and <tt>vi</tt> will work; on Windows,
Notepad or DOS Edit are both text editors that will work (although
I prefer to use the shareware TextPad). On the Macintosh, SimpleText
(which came with your Mac) or the shareware BBedit will work.
If you're using a development environment like Caf√© or
Roaster, it'll have its own built-in text editor you can use.

<tr valign="TOP"><td>
<blockquote>
If you're using Windows to do your Java development, you may have to make sure Windows understands the <tt>.java</tt> file extension before you start; otherwise, your text editor may insist on giving all your files a <tt>.txt</tt> extension. The easiest 
way to do this is to go to any Windows Explorer window, choose View|Options|File Types, choose New Type, and add <tt>Java Source File</tt> and <tt>.java</tt> to the Description of Type and Associated Extension boxes, respectively.

Fire up your editor of choice and enter the Java program shown

<p>
</p><p>
After you've finished typing in the program, save the file somewhere
on your disk with the name <tt>HelloWorld.java</tt>.
This is very important. Java source files must have the same name
as the class they define (including the same upper- and lowercase
letters), and they must have the extension <tt>.java</tt>.
Here, the class definition has the name <tt>HelloWorld</tt>,
so the filename must be <tt>HelloWorld.java</tt>.
If you name your file something else (even something like <tt>helloworld.java</tt>
or <tt>Helloworld.java</tt>), you
won't be able to compile it. Make absolutely certain the name
is <tt>HelloWorld.java</tt>.
</p><p>
You can save your Java files anywhere you like on your disk, but
I like to have a central directory or folder to keep them all
in. For the examples in this chapter, I've put my files into a
directory called <tt>TYJtests</tt>
(short for Teach Yourself Java Tests).
</p><h4>Compiling and Running the Source File</h4>
<p>
Now it's time to compile the file. If you're using the JDK, you
can use the instructions for your computer system contained in
the next few pages. If you're using a graphical development environment,
there will most likely be a button or option to compile the file
(check with the documentation that came with your program).<br>

Once you've changed to the right directory, use the <tt>javac</tt>

<tt>HELLOW~1.jav</tt>. Don't panic; this is simply a side effect of Windows 95 and how it manages long filenames. Ignore the fact that the file appears to be <tt>HELLOW~1.jav</tt> and just use the filename you originally used when you saved the file.

</p><p>
If all goes well, you'll end up with a file called <tt>HelloWorld.class</tt>
(or at least that's what it'll be called if you look at it outside
the DOS shell; from inside DOS its called <tt>HELLOW~1.cla</tt>).
That's your Java bytecode file. If you get any errors, go back
to your original source file and make sure you typed it exactly
as it appears in Listing 1.1 with the same upper- and lowercase.
Also make sure the filename has exactly the same upper- and lowercase
as the name of the class (that is, both should be <tt>HelloWorld</tt>).
</p><p>
Once you have a class file, you can run that file using the Java
bytecode interpreter. The Java interpreter is called simply <tt>java</tt>,
and you run it from the DOS shell as you did <tt>javac</tt>.
Run your Hello World program like this from the command line,
with all the same upper- and lowercase (and note that the argument
to the <tt>java</tt> program does
not have a <tt>.class</tt>

</p><blockquote>

To compile the Java source file in Solaris, you'll use the command-line
Java compiler that comes with the JDK. From a UNIX command line,
<tt>cd</tt> to the directory that

so to change directories I'd use this command:

command with the name of the file, like this:

Creating a Java Applet</a></h3>
<p>
Creating applets is different from creating a simple application.
Java applets run and are displayed inside a Web page with other
page elements, and therefore have special rules for how they behave.
Because of these special rules for applets, creating an applet
may in many cases be more complex than creating an application.
</p><p>
For example, to create a simple Hello World applet, instead of
merely being able to print a message as a set of characters, you
have to make space for your message on the Web pages and then
use special font and graphics operations to paint the message
to the screen.<br>

<p>
</p><h4>Creating the Source File</h4>
<p>
In this example, you'll create a simple Hello World applet, place
it inside a Web page, and view the result. As with the Hello World
application, you'll first create the source file in a plain text
editor. Listing 1.2 shows the code for the example.
</p><hr>
<blockquote>
<b>Listing 1.2. The Hello World applet.<br>
</b>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre>1: import java.awt.Graphics;
2: 
3: public class HelloWorldApplet extends java.applet.Applet {
4: 
5:     public void paint(Graphics g) {
6:        g.drawString("Hello world!", 5, 25);
7:    }
8:}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>
Save that file just as you did the Hello World application, with
the filename exactly the same as the name of the class. In this
case the class name is <tt>HelloWorldApplet</tt>,
so the filename you save it to would be <tt>HelloWorldApplet.java</tt>.
As with the application, I put the file in a directory called
<tt>TYJch01</tt>, but you can save
it anywhere you like.
</p><h4>Compiling the Source File</h4>
<p>
The next step is to compile the Java applet file. Despite the
fact that this is an applet, you compile the file exactly the
same way you did the Java application, using one of the following
procedures:<br>
</p><blockquote>
<pre>javac HelloWorldApplet.java
javac HelloWorldApplet.java

file; to have the applet run inside a Web page you must refer

You'll learn more about <tt>&lt;APPLET&gt;</tt>
later in this book, but here are two things to note about it:
</p><ul>
<li>Use the <tt>CODE</tt> attribute
to indicate the name of the class that contains your applet, here
<tt>HelloWorldApplet.Class</tt>.
</li><li>Use the <tt>WIDTH</tt> and <tt>HEIGHT</tt>
attributes to indicate the size of the applet on the page. The
browser uses these values to know how big a chunk of space to
leave for the applet on the page. Here, a box 150 pixels wide
and 25 pixels high is created.
</li></ul>
<p>
Save the HTML file in the same directory as your class file, with
a descriptive name and an <tt>.html</tt>
extension (for example, you might name your HTML file the same
name as your applet-<tt>HelloWorldApplet.html</tt>).

As mentioned earlier with the Java source files, your text editor may insist on naming your HTML files with a .txt extension if Windows does not understand what the .html extension is used for. Select View|Options|File Types from any Windows Explorer

Now you're ready for the final test-actually viewing the result
of running your applet. To view the applet, you need one of the
following:
</p><ul>
<li>A browser that supports Java applets, such as Netscape 2.0
or Internet Explorer 3.0. If you're running on the Macintosh,
you'll need Netscape 3.0 or later. If you're running on Windows
95 or NT, you'll need the 32-bit version of Netscape. And if you're
using Internet Explorer, you'll need the 3.0 beta 5 or later (the
final version will do just fine). 
</li><li>The <tt>appletviewer</tt> application,
which is part of the JDK. The <tt>appletviewer</tt>
is not a Web browser and won't let you to see the entire Web page,
but it's acceptable for testing to see how an applet will look
and behave if there is nothing else available.
</li><li>An applet viewer or runner tool that comes with your development
environment. 
</li></ul>
<p>
If you're using a Java-enabled browser such as Netscape to view
your applet files, you can use the Open File... item under the
File menu to navigate to the HTML file containing the applet (make
sure you open the HTML file and not the class file). In Internet
Explorer, select File|Open and then Browse to find the file on
your disk. You don't need to install anything on a Web server
yet; all this works on your local system. Note that the Java applet
may take a while to start up after the page appears to be done
loading; be patient. Figure 1.8 shows the result of running the
applet in Netscape.
</p><p>
<a href="f1-8.gif"><b>Figure 1.8 : </b><i>The applet running in Netscape</i>.</a>
</p><p>
If you don't have a Web browser with Java capabilities built into
it, you can use the JDK's <tt>appletviewer</tt>
program to view your Java applet.</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="Troubleshooting"><font size="5" color="#FF0000">
Troubleshooting</font></a></h2>
<p>
If you've run into any problems with the previous examples, this
section can help. Here are some of the most common problems and
how to fix them:
</p><ul>
<li><tt>Bad command or filename</tt>
or <tt>Command not found<br>
</tt>These errors result when you do not have the JDK's
<tt>bin</tt> directory in your execution
path, or the path to that directory is wrong. On Windows, double-check
your <tt>autoexec.bat</tt> file; on
UNIX, check the system file with your path commands in it (<tt>.cshrc</tt>,
<tt>.login</tt>, <tt>.profile</tt>,
or some similar file).
</li><li><tt>javac: invalid argument<br>
</tt>Make sure the name of the file you're giving to the
<tt>javac</tt> command is exactly
the same name as the file. In particular, in the DOS shell you
want to use the Windows filename with a <tt>.java</tt>
extension, not the DOS equivalent
(<tt>HELLOW~1.jav</tt>, for example).
</li><li><tt>Warning: public class HelloWorldApplet
must be defined in a file called HelloWorldApplet.java<br>
</tt>This error most often happens if there is a mismatch
between the name of the class as defined in the Java file itself
(the name following the word class)
and the name of the <tt>java</tt>
source file. Both the filenames must match, including upper- and
lowercase letters (this particular error implies that the filename
had lowercase letters). Rename either the filename or the class
name, and this error will go away.
</li><li>Insufficient-memory errors<br>
The JDK is not the most efficient user of memory. If you're getting
errors about memory, consider closing larger programs before running
Java compiles, turn on virtual memory, or install more RAM.
</li><li>Other code errors<br>
If you're unable to compile the Java source files because of other
errors I haven't mentioned here, be sure that you've typed them
in exactly as they appear, including all upper- and lowercase
letters. Java is case sensitive, meaning that upper- and lowercase
letters are treated differently, so you will need to make sure
that everything is capitalized correctly. If all else fails, try
comparing your source files to the files on the CD-ROM.
</li></ul>
<h2><a name="Summary"><font size="5" color="#FF0000">
Summary</font></a></h2>
<p>
Today you've gotten a basic introduction to the Java language
and its goals and features. Java is a programming language, similar
to C or C++, in which you can develop a wide range of programs.
The most common use of Java at the moment is in creating applets
for HotJava, an advanced World Wide Web browser also written in
Java. Applets are Java programs that are downloaded and run as
part of a Web page. Applets can create animation, games, interactive
programs, and other multimedia effects on Web pages.
</p><p>
Java's strengths lie in its portability-both at the source and
at the binary level, in its object-oriented design-and in its
simplicity. Each of these features helps make applets possible,
but they also make Java an excellent language for writing more
general-purpose programs that do not require a Java-enabled browser
to run. These general-purpose Java programs are called applications.
</p><p>
To end this day, you experimented with an example of an applet
and an example of an application, getting a feel for the differences
between the two and how to create, compile, and run Java programs-or,
in the case of applets, how to include them in Web pages. From
here, you now have the foundation to create more complex applications
and applets. Onward to <a href="ch2.htm">Day 2</a>, "Object-Oriented Programming
and Java"!

<tr valign="TOP"><td width="40"><center><b>A:</b></center></td><td>If you have no programming experience whatsoever, you most likely will find programming Java significantly more difficult than HTML. However, Java is an excellent language to learn programming 
with, and if you patiently work through the examples and the exercises in this book, you should be able to learn enough to get started with Java.

<br>
A common misconception in the Web world today is that Java and JavaScript have more in common than they actually do. Java is the general-purpose programming language that you'll learn about in this book; you use it to create applets. JavaScript is a 
Netscape-invented scripting language that looks sort of like Java; with it you can do various nifty things in Web pages. They are independent languages, used for different purposes. If you're interested in JavaScript programming, you'll want to pick up 
another book, such as Teach Yourself JavaScript in a Week or Laura Lemay's Web Workshop: JavaScript, both also available from Sams.net Publishing.

<tr valign="TOP"><td width="40"><center><b>Q:</b></center></td><td><b>According to today's lesson, Java applets are downloaded via a Java-enabled browser such as Netscape and run on the reader's system. Isn't that an enormous security hole? What stops someone 
from writing an applet that compromises the security of my system-or worse, that damages my system?</b>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="TOP"><td width="40"><center><b>A:</b></center></td><td>Sun's Java team has thought a great deal about the security of applets within Java-enabled browsers and has implemented several checks to make sure applets cannot do nasty things:
<ul>
<li>Java applets cannot read or write to the disk on the local system.
</li><li>Java applets cannot execute any programs on the local system.
</li><li>Java applets cannot connect to any machines on the Web except for the server from which they are originally downloaded.
</li></ul>
<p>
Note that some of these restrictions may be allowed in some browsers or may be turned on in the browser configuration. However, you cannot expect any of these capabilities to be available.</p><p>
In addition, the Java compiler and interpreter check both the Java source code and the Java bytecodes to make sure that the Java programmer has not tried any sneaky tricks (for example, overrunning buffers or stack frames).</p><p>
These checks obviously cannot stop every potential security hole (no system can promise that!), but they can significantly reduce the potential for hostile applets. You'll learn more about security issues for applets on <a href="ch8.htm">Day 8</a>, 
"Java Applet Basics," and in greater detail on <a href="ch21.htm">Day 21</a>, "Under the Hood."

<tr valign="TOP"><td width="40"><center><b>A:</b></center></td><td>Don't use HotJava to view applets you've created in this book; get a more up-to-date browser such as Netscape or Internet Explorer. HotJava was an experimental browser and has not been updated 
since soon after its original release. The steps you take to define and write an applet have changed since then, and the applets you write now will not run on HotJava.
